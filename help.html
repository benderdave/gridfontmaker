  <h1><center> GridfontMaker v1.0 </center></h1>
     <p>Gridfontmaker is a tool for designing Gridfonts as described in
     <it>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</it>, by Douglas Hofstadter.
     A gridfont is a font made up of 26 glyphs representing the lowercase 
     letters of the English
     alphabet. Each letter is drawn on a 3x7 grid with connections allowed
     only between neighbors (including diagonals.)
     <p>Briefly, the editor contains four areas, from top to bottom:
     <ul>
        <li>Font name</li>
        <li>Small a-z display</li>
        <li>Editable letters</li>
        <li>Editable text area</li>
     <ul>
  <hr>
  <h1>Font name</h1>
     <p class="m">This area allows you to enter or change the current name of the font. We
     recommend you include the name of the designer, e.g. "Slanted by Sandy
     Swan".
  <hr>
  <h1>Small a-z display</h1>
     <p class="m">This area contains a small rendering of the lowercase alphabet (a-z) in
     the current font. Use +/- to change the font size when the mouse is over
     this area.
  <hr>
  <h1>Editable letters</h1>
     <p>This area contains two rows with all 26 letters. Edit each letter in-place
     by dragging the mouse between anchor points to create a stroke. Delete
     strokes by clicking on them. 
     <p>When hovering over a letter..
     <ul>
        <li>Use <b>arrows</b> to nudge the strokes up, down, left and to the
        right.</li>
        <li>Press <b>h</b> to flip the letter horizontally.</li>
        <li>Press <b>v</b> to flip the letter vertically.</li>
        <li>Press <b>c</b> to clear the letter.</li>
        <li>Press <b>o</b> to see the order of strokes. Stroke numbers are displayed
        nearest to their starting anchor.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>When hovering over a stroke..
     <ul>
        <li>Press <b>f</b> to flip the direction of the stroke.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>When hovering over the dark rectange at the bottom of a letter the
     letter is selected. Here..
     <ul>
        <li><b>Drag</b> the mouse to copy the letter onto another letter.</li>
        <li><b>Shift-Drag</b> with the mouse to move the letter in between two other
        letters. (This is so you can work on two letters side-by-side if
        desired.)</li>
     </ul>
  <hr>
  <h1>Editable text area</h1>
  <p class="m">Type any text here that you would like to see displayed in your font.
     Use +/- to change the font size when the mouse is over this area.
