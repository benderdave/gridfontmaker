  <h1><center> GridfontMaker v1.1 </center></h1>
     <p>Gridfontmaker is a tool for designing Gridfonts as described in
     <it>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</it>, by Douglas Hofstadter.
     A gridfont is a font made up of 26 glyphs representing the lowercase 
     letters of the English
     alphabet. Each letter is drawn on a 3x7 grid with connections allowed
     only between neighbors (including 45 degree diagonals.)
     <p>Briefly, the editor contains four areas, from top to bottom:
     <ul>
        <li>Font name</li>
        <li>Small a-z display</li>
        <li>Editable letters</li>
        <li>Editable text area</li>
     <ul>
  <hr>
  <h1>Font name</h1>
     <p class="m">This area allows you to enter or change the current name of the font. We
     recommend you include the name of the designer, e.g. "Curiosity by Sandy
     Swan".
  <hr>
  <h1>Small a-z display</h1>
     <p class="m">This area contains a small rendering of the lowercase alphabet (a-z) in
     the current font. Use +/- to change the font size when this area is
     selected (click with the mouse to select.) You can also add other
     gridfonts to this area so that you can compare an existing font to the one
     you are currectly working on.
  <hr>
  <h1>Editable letters</h1>
     <p>This area contains two rows with all 26 letters. Edit each letter in-place
     by dragging the mouse between anchor points to create a stroke, or by
     clicking on an empty spot where a new stroke can be added. Delete
     strokes by clicking on them. 
     <p>When hovering over a letter..
     <ul>
        <li>Use <b>arrows</b> to nudge the strokes up, down, left and to the
        right.</li>
        <li>Press <b>h</b> to flip the letter horizontally.</li>
        <li>Press <b>v</b> to flip the letter vertically.</li>
        <li>Press <b>r</b> to rotate the letter 180 degrees around its center.</li>
        <li>Press <b>c</b> to clear the letter.</li>
        <li>Press <b>a</b> to clear all letters <i>except</i> this one. (It's
        common for a letter in one typeface to become the seed for a completely
        different, new typeface.)</li>
        <li>Press <b>o</b> to see the order of strokes. Stroke numbers are displayed
        nearest to their starting anchor.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>When hovering over a stroke..
     <ul>
        <li>Press <b>f</b> to flip the direction of the stroke.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>When hovering over the dark rectange at the bottom of a letter the
     letter is selected. Here..
     <ul>
        <li><b>Drag</b> the mouse to copy the letter onto another letter.</li>
        <li><b>Shift-Drag</b> with the mouse to move the letter in between two other
        letters. (This is so you can work on two letters side-by-side if
        desired. Use the <b>Sort</b> action in the <b>grid</b> menu to restore the
        original order.)</li>
     </ul>
  <hr>
  <h1>Editable text area</h1>
  <p class="m">Type any text here that you would like to see displayed in your font.
     Use +/- to change the font size when this area is selected. Hold down a
     CONTROL or ALT key when pressing +/- for finer adjustment.
